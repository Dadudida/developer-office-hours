# Stripe Customer Portal

The [Customer
Portal](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/integrating-customer-portal)
is a Stripe hosted page where your customers can manage their billing. It can
be challenging to build all of the functionality for managing billing so we
built the customer portal so you don't have to. The following guide covers our
office hours session from June 29, 2020.

### Developer introduction [ðŸŽ¬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8H6awDJVpM&t=5s)

Everyone who has built a saas application can tell you there are many moving
parts, you need a pricing page, to keep track of your subscribers and their
subscriptions, likely a page to upgrade or downgrade between service offerings,
and a way to cancel. Your customers payment methods will change over time and
will need to be updated. All of this is complicated further when dealing with
secure customer authentication and provisioning. Weâ€™re ecstatic share the new
customer portal which abstracts away a lot of this pain.

### Product overview [ðŸŽ¬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8H6awDJVpM&t=5s)

You can cut down your integration time and the time to launch your product with the customer portal.

There is a UI where customers can interact with to manage their billing.
Customers can change their plan, cancel their plan, change their payment
method, or see their billing history. It's no secret these are a lot of pieces
of building a product that aren't neccisarily going to differentiate your
product, but are things you just kinda have to build. Today, you'll see how
Stripe can manage this for you so you don't have to build it yourself.

In testmode in your Stripe dashboard, you can head over to your settings, under
"Billing" > "Customer Portal" you can configure and customize your portal. You
can setup your brand settings and business name. You can choose to
enable certain functionality in the portal, such as allowing the customer to
view their billing history. Payment method updates will be auto allowed as long
as subscription updates are allowed.

You can add which products customers can switch too if you enable subscription udates.

When a user makes that switch you can choose to prorate that change and whether
to make that change take place immediately or at the end of your billing
period. Same with cancellations, you can prorate and make that take effect
immediately or at the end of the billing period.

You can customize the business information like headline and links. You can
then see a preview of what comes out of the box. You don't have to manage any
of this yourself.

### Product and Price modeling [ðŸŽ¬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8H6awDJVpM&t=5s)

You can now model your business and product offerings in one place.

Products define what you sell, prices track how much and how often to charge. A
product can be used for recurring or one time purchases and it supports various
business structures from tiers to usage based billing. These are both core
entities within Stripe which work with Subscriptions, Invoices, and Checkout.

Products are the highest level. Products are what you sell. You'll need to create
at least one before you can charge for it. When you're building a saas application
with the "good" "better" "best" model you would have at least 3 products. A product for the "good", a product for the "better" and a product for the "best"

Each of the levels represents a different set of faetures or different levels of feature value.

In the past you may have created one single product at the top level with multiple plans under that one product for each of the product levels.

However, in order to take advantage of the customer prortal we need to make sure we get the modeling correct from the get go. Also if you have a setup fee for one of your plans at one of these levels, you'll want to create that as a separate product also.


The API call is pretty simple to create a product. We create the Product by passing in a name and any optional arguments like description images or a URL.

```rb
Stripe::Product.create(name: "starter")
```

Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes the product cost, which currency to use, and if it's a recurring price the billing intervale. When we create a price, we assign it to the product and specify the unit amount, currency, and optional interval.

```rb
Stripe::Price.create(
  product: "prod_xxx",
  unit_amount: 500,
  currency: "usd",
  recurring: {
    interval: "month"
  },
  lookup_key: "starter")
```

Note that if the IDs of Prices are hard coded into your pricing page and you
want to change it later, typically the process is manual and you'd need to
deploy new code. Instead of managing price changes with a deploy, you can use
this awesome new feature called `lookup_key`. The key allows you to refer to
the key in your pricing page and swap out the price later with
`transfer_lookup_key` without needing to change the hard coded prices.

You can render different prices in the front end, then use the rendered price to bill
the customers. The pricing page in the demo was built with lookup keys.

In the response we'll see the ID of the price which we can use to reference.

We can also list prices by their lookup_key to get back a list of prices given an array of `lookup_keys`.


Now that we've modeled our business and we can create products and prices.
Let's get into the core of the demo which is redirecting to the customer
portal.


### Redirect to the portal [ðŸŽ¬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8H6awDJVpM&t=5s)

[Guide to integrating the customer portal]()

From Step 2 in the guide, we

The Portal Session is the entry point into the customer portal. There is a
unique short lived link that we can send customers to for each session. We want
to add a button to our UI. When that button is clicked we'll send a POST
request to the backend to create a billing portal session and redirect to the
URL of the session.

Today's demo application is a private podcasting interface. In the demo,
we start from the list of private podcast episodes and show the authenticated user.

We want to add a button to the episodes index which will redirect to the
billing portal.



Concerning the database: we have the email address, hashed password, the plan for the customer which is the `lookup_key` for our Price. The Stripe Customer ID and the Subscription status in the database. The Subscription status allows us to provision access and control whether the user has access or not.

From the dashbaord.html.erb layout, we want to add our button that will redirect to the customer portal.

```html
<form action="/customer_portal_sessions" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="<%= form_authenticity_token %>">
  <button>Manage Billing</button>
</form>
```

Next we need to create a route that will create a Customer Portal. This is done in a new controller.

```sh
rails generate controller CustomerPortalSessions
```

This will be the controller that contains our redirect.

We need to pull the customer ID out of the database. It might be stored in Firebase or some external database, but we want to pass the Stripe customer ID for the authenticated customer. In rails, we access the authenticated user through `current_user`.


```rb
def create
  portal_session = Stripe::BillingPortal::Session.create(
    customer: current_user.stripe_customer_id,
    return_url: 'http://localhost:3000/episodes'
  )
  redirect_to portal_session.url
end
```

The portal session has a property called the `url` and that is where we want to redirect to. In rails we can call the `redirect_to` method and pass it the URL of the session.

The last thing we need to do in Rails is define the route. In `routes.rb` we add:

```rb
resources :customer_portal_sessions, only: [:create]
```

We only need to support the `create` action for this controller.

Now we can test this out by loading our page and clicking on
"Manage Billing" to redirect to the billing portal.

Try changing between plans, try updating your payment method
with `4242424242424242` or `4000002500003155` to experiment
with secure customer authentication.

Note that you can set a new default payment method. You can
also switch back to the old payment method and make that your
default. Review the billing history.

Try cancelling your plan to end the customer lifecycle.

After heading back to the demo in the browser, you'll notice
that the subscription status hasn't changed. The next step is
to update the webhook handler to provision and deprovision
access based on actions taken in the customer portal.

### Automate provisioning and deprovisioning [ðŸŽ¬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8H6awDJVpM&t=5s)

From Step 3 in the integrating the customer portal guide, it's
time to listen to webhooks to receive updates to a customers
subscriptions and payment methods.

When subscriptions are changing, upgraded downgraded or
cancelled, we want to be notified of that so we can update our
database. Here we have a couple different event types
`customer.subscription.updated` and
`customer.subscription.deleted` are the two types we listen to
in this demo, but you might also want to listen to the payment
method being attached or detached and the customer being
updated if you want to know when the customer changes which
payment method is set as default.

There are a few great guides for working with webhooks that
walk through full code examples about building webhook
handlers. Wer're going to start from something very much like
the example with sinatra, we also have a Stripe Developer
Office hours episode all about webhooks. If you're curious
about how to implement webhooks go checkout those resources.

For now, we want to ensure access is provisioned to the
correct product and that we're cancellign subscriptions and
remoivng access when the customer chooses to cancel.


You can startup a stripe listener which is going to create a
direct connection between stripe and your local machine so
that when events happen on your stripe account they are
delivered to your local webhook handler. There's anotehr
Stripe Developer Office hours episode all about the Stripe CLI
and how to you can use this tool to build and test your Stripe
integration.

```sh
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/webhooks
```

We have a `WebhooksController` already created and `resources :webhooks` already setup in `routes.rb`

We're going to update our webhook handler to add support for `customer.subscription.updated` and `customer.subscription.deleted`.

We first extract the subscription from the event data
(`event.data.object`) then lookup the User by their Stripe
Customer ID.

Then we update the user object to update the subscription status to the status of the subscription as shown in the webhook event.

Then update the plan to be the `lookup_key`.


```rb
when 'customer.subscription.updated', 'customer.subscription.deleted'
  subscription = event.data.object
  @user = User.find_by(stripe_customer_id: subscription.customer)
  @user.update(
    subscription_status: subscription.status,
    plan: subscription.items.data[0].price.lookup_key
   )
end
```

Note this works because we know we're only using one plan per
subscription so we can be confident that we can reach in and
grab the first item in the list and one of it's lookup_key's
will be one of starter, pro, or enterprise. We want to update
our user so we can give the right amount of access to the
customer.

If we go the `customer.subscription.deleted` event this works
the same way. We want to update the subscription statuss to be
`cancelled` which will be the status of the subscription on
the event data we receive. That should successfully cancel
that users access.

Our application uses Stripe Checkout to start the subscription. In the webhook handler, you'll notice the `checkout.session.completed` event type is already implemented. Thats because the demo uses Stripe Checkout to start the subscription and we want to update the user's subscription status to active.

Try signing up and notice that when you register you're
redirected to Stripe Checkout, you can go through the payment
flow with the 4242424242424242 card and subscribe the test
customer to the Starter plan. When you're redirected back
you'll see that the checkout session was handled and we have
the subscription status updated to `active`. We also see that
we are now subscribed to "Starter". Click on manage billing
and change from starter to pro from the customer portal and
ensure that change takes effect in your application.

Note you're charged for the upgrade. You can see the status
updated in the demo.

Sometimes webhooks are delivered immediately, sometimes they
will arrive before the local browser can refresh. You'll want
to provision and deprovision based on webhooks because the
retry logic for webhooks is very powerful.

Experiment with more upgrades and downgrades and ultimately
attempt to cancel.


# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why isn't `Stripe::BillingPortal` defined when I attempt to access that?

A: Most likely because of an older version of stripe-ruby. Try upgrading to latest.
