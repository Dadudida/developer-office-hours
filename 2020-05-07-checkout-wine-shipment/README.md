## How to run

This project uses [Express](http://expressjs.com) as its server. Here's how to run it after cloning.

1. Create and populate a `.env` file. There's a starter example you can copy in `server/`.

```
cp server/example.env server/.env
# Then open server/.env in your text editor and paste in the API keys for your account.
```

2. Install dependencies and start up the server.

```
cd server/
npm install
npm start
```

3. Go in your browser `http://localhost:4242` to see the demo
